This project was build following Brad Traversy's Modern React Front To Back 2019 Udemy coarse. This first section of that course covered class based components and went on to feractor the app into functional components with React.createContext() via Hooks.
The live version of this app can be viewed at https://v1githubfinder.netlify.com/
