This project was built following Brad Traversy's Modern React Front To Back 2019 Udemy coarse. This first section of that course covered class based components and went on to refactor the app into functional components with React.createContext() via Hooks.
The live version of this app can be viewed at https://v1githubfinder.netlify.com/ 
I will be refactoring this app to use styled-components and customizing the design.
